# ApyxEngine-Flask-Prototype-Demo

Short (1 min) screenrecording of the proposed interface of the flask app I wrote to handle company-wide GIS requests, here still in its infancy.

The demo shows several front end features, and illustrates backend interactions with a text configuration file.

One of the premises of the app is that this text config, which guides an intensive backend geospatial analysis, must be in a specific format, which the app is now able to enforce.

We needed to use a text file, over an ArcGIS GUI, because these options are higly fluid, dependend upon shifting standards, and geospatial data availability on our servers.
